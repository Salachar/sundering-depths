    <>
      Hydrotechs are water-channelers and steam technicians who maintain irrigation arrays, pressure gates, and Weave Harmonizer cooling systems. Their blend of arcane practice and practical hydraulics is vital for keeping floating settlements stable and livable. When pipes rupture, harmonics fail, or an elemental gets loose in the plumbing, it's the Hydrotechs who get called in.

        Not a stick, not quite a pipe, but some personalized conduit of brass, bone, or glass. Etched with a ruler and symbols only Hydrotechs fully understand, it's less a weapon and more a tuning fork arcane energy. In a Hydrotechs hands, a ripple can become a jet, or droplet a blade. Each is handmade, generally under mentorship while in studies.
